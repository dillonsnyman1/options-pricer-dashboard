# Providers and remote state backend for the application infrastructure.
#
# The S3 backend is intentionally left partially configured - bucket, key,
# region and dynamodb_table are supplied at `terraform init` time via
# -backend-config flags (see .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml and
# infra/bootstrap/), so the bootstrap-created bucket/table names don't need
# to be hardcoded or committed.
